    <p><b>Hello and welcome to my brand new portfolio site.</b><br/>
      I am an ambitious developer with a special interest in Ruby on Rails, I have completed
      a Higher Diploma in Web Technologies at the National College of Ireland where a very patient tutor helped to give me the knowledge
      and appreciation of rails. My Higher Diploma was graded with a first class honors.</p>
    <p>I am relatively new to the developing world as i have spent most of my career in retail
      i always knew that i could achieve more, but i needed that push to move away from retail.
      When i lost my job i took that as an opportunity to restart and redirect my career in to
      development.</p>

    <h4>Why Rails ?</h4>
    <p>Since 2012 Ruby on Rails has become my favourite technology to use. I have just finished building my final project which is a social network with exciting features using rails.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy working in rails because it is so productive and is only limited by the
      developerâ€™s imagination, it can transform my ideas in to powerful working applications that people can use and enjoy. </p>

    <h4>Internship or Junior role</h4>
    <p>I am looking to hear from companies that would like to take me on as a Ruby on Rails intern,
      in return i can offer my hard work to contribute some value and also loyalty to the company.</p>
    <p>I would also like to hear about any junior or entry level positions as a Ruby on Rails developer, if
      the position matches my current skill level.</p>

    <p>I am based in Dublin, Ireland but it would be interesting to hear from companies outside of Ireland also.</p>
